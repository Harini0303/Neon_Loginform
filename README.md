# Neon_Loginform

<p> By Using HTML and CSS I have Created this Login Form.</p>

<p> A login form utilizes the credentials of a user, in order to authenticate their access. It generally consists of the typical username or email and password.</p>

<p> The icons are used from the website <a href="https://ionic.io/ionicons">Ionicons.</a> </p>
